**Open-ended**

For this assignment, you may choose one of the following options. You'll only get credit for doing one, but you may do both if you find them both to be of use to you at this point in the semester.

### Option 1: Prepare for Final Project

Write a two-page draft of your final project idea for review. What specific policy issue do you want to investigate? Why? What is the larger political context for this issue? What are the potential angles you could take in thinking about and analyzing this policy problem?

### Option 2: Re-write of Previous Assignment

Re-write one of your first three assignments based on the feedback we provided and your own development over the course of the semester. If the quality of your work (e.g. argument and writing) improves, we will assign a higher grade. This grade won't replace the lower one, but rather will count for Assignment 4. If you choose to revise an assignment originally completed as part of a partner or group project, you will still need to make revisions on your own.
