**Hometown Analysis**

A critical part of creating policy is the data gathering process. What data can you find quickly and analyze? What do the data mean? What story can you tell using reliable data? What data do you need?

Cities and towns are under enormous amounts of strain. Budgets are tight, costs of many public services continue to escalate and no one wants to pay more taxes. At the same time, new problems keep cropping up: Heroin overdoses are epidemic in Hyannis, MA; many school buildings in towns around Massachusetts are outdated, dangerous, and falling down (just last winter, the city of Somerville witnessed the collapse of a roof of one of its elementary schools); flood control systems were just implemented in the town of Winchester after an historic flood in downtown happened several years ago; Flint, MI is currently experiencing contaminated drinking water supply, among many other problems.

Using your hometown as the subject of your investigation, assume that you are a policy analyst and you work for the new mayor or the new town or city council.

What data can you use to tell a story about your hometown? Where is it located? How many people live there? What does it provide in terms of resources to the state?

Next, investigate the most pressing public policy issues for your town. The local newspaper can be one source that can help you. Also, locating and reviewing a local budget and / or agenda items for a town meeting can help you understand the priorities of your town.

What are the key policy concerns your town is grappling with in 2016?
